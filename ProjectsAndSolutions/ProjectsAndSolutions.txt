Project:
A project is where your code lives. A project encapsulates one type of code and  of application.
A project could be self contained, everything it needs to run that application.

Solution:
It is like a bucket that holds projects together. We put together related projects in a solution for easier access. 

Pascal casing is the industry standard for naming projects and solutions. No spaces are allowed in the names.
