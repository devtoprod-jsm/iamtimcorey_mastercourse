Project:
A project is where your code lives. A project encapsulates one type of code and of application.
A project could be self contained, everything it needs to run that application.

Solution:
It is like a bucket that holds projects together. We put together related projects in a solution for easier access.
Extra projects included are generally library code to support the application in primary project.
Projects in a solution are not necessarily related. Projects are boundary for a particular type of code or application.

Solution is a bucket and the project is where the code lives!!!

Pascal casing is the industry standard for naming projects and solutions. No spaces are allowed in the names.

Keywords:
using: Is a way to shortcut reference or FQN for a library.
namespace: A namespace is a way of naming or grouping various code parts together.
By default the root namespace takes the project name.
Create folders and name the namespace accordingly (projectname.foldername) for code that logically goes together.
scope: A curly brace indicates scope in C#.
Class:
Generally we start in program class, main method (where our application starts to execute).
We genrally name files after the classes that are inside them. Generally we put one class in onefile.(recommended)
Method: Lives inside of classes. Main(keyword that indicates) method is used to launch your application.
